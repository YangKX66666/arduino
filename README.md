# Resources

## Online Tutorials
- [Adafruit's 18-Step Learn Arduino Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/learn-arduino) is my most recommended "getting started" guide for Arduino. [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com), in general, has an extensive number of [online electronic tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/)—both for their products and beyond.

- [Sparkfun's Tutorial Series](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials). Similar to Adafruit, [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) creates a large number of tutorials and videos to help the electronic/maker community (and build demand for their products).

- [NYU ITP's Physical Computing Course Website](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/). Tom Igoe's Physical Computing course at NYU's ITP offers a significant amount of online tutorials such as an introductory overview of [Electricity](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/electronics/electricity-the-basics/), [Sensors](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/sensors-the-basics/) and [digital I/O](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers/digital-input-output/). [Igoe](https://tigoe.com/) is one of the co-founders of Arduino and the author of [Physical Computing](https://www.amazon.com/Physical-Computing-Sensing-Controlling-Computers/dp/159200346X) and [Making Things Talk](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510510.do)

## Video Tutorials

- [Physical Computing @ ITP/NYU](https://vimeo.com/channels/pcomp). This online video series by NYU ITP's Jeff Feddersen & Tom Igoe provides over 100 extremely high-quality teaching videos about circuits, & Arduino

## Where to Ask Questions
- Stack exchange for EE Arduino
- Reddit with links to DIy electornics and arduino

## Books
While there are numerous Arduino and electronics books, generally, I find that online guides offer the best quality learning content. Some exceptions include:
- Jeremey Blumstein book. This is my favorite Arduino book. Interestingly, Blumstein was inspired to work in physical computing after taking Cornell HCI Professor [François Guimbretière](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~francois/) *Introduction to Rapid Prototyping and Physical Computing* course.
- Make Electronics book

## TODO:
- Look at my resources list from CMSC838f (will have to use archive.org since page is down).
- Look at: http://ladyada.net/learn/arduino/
- Look at some related online courses:
-- EdX IOT: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UPValenciaX+IOT101.1x+3T2019a/course/
-- https://www.coursera.org/specializations/iot
-- https://www.instructables.com/class/Arduino-Class/
- Look at related academic courses
-- E.g., Mayanks
