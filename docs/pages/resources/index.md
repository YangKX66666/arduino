## Online Tutorials

- [Adafruit's 18-Step Learn Arduino Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/learn-arduino) is my most recommended "getting started" guide for Arduino. [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com), in general, has an extensive number of [online electronic tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/)—both for their own products and beyond.

- [Sparkfun's Tutorial Series](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials). Similar to Adafruit, [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) creates a large number of tutorials and videos to help the electronic/maker community (and build demand for their products).

- [NYU ITP's Physical Computing Course Website](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/). Tom Igoe's Physical Computing course at NYU's ITP offers a significant amount of online tutorials such as an introductory overview of [Electricity](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/electronics/electricity-the-basics/), [Sensors](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/sensors-the-basics/) and [digital I/O](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers/digital-input-output/). [Igoe](https://tigoe.com/) is one of the co-founders of Arduino and the author of [Physical Computing](https://www.amazon.com/Physical-Computing-Sensing-Controlling-Computers/dp/159200346X) and [Making Things Talk](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510510.do)

- [Arduino's Official Tutorials](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage). Lots of tutorials from [foundational concepts](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations) to explaining the built-in [Arduino IDE examples](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples)

## Video Tutorials

- [Physical Computing @ ITP/NYU](https://vimeo.com/channels/pcomp). This online video series by NYU ITP's Jeff Feddersen & Tom Igoe provides over 100 high-quality teaching videos about circuits, & Arduino

## Books

I've gone through a large set of electronics and microcontroller books. Here are some of my favorites. I've attempted to supply EBook library links whenever possible.

### Electronics

- Charles Platt, *Make: Electronics*, 2nd Edition, Maker Media, 2015 [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71290798850001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/make-electronics-2nd/9781680450255/)]. The best 'Intro to Electronics' book I've found.

- Simon Monk, *Hacking Electronics: An Illustrated DIY Guide for Makers and Hobbyists*, McGraw-Hill, 2013. [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71297764200001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hacking-electronics-an/9780071802369/)]

### Advanced Electronics

- Paul Scherz and Simon Monk, Practical Electronics for Inventors, 4th Edition, McGraw-Hill Education, 2016. [UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71291894620001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-electronics-for/9781259587559) This is a more advanced book, *e.g.,* the first chapter entitled *Theory* is 200+ pages long.

- Charles Platt, *Make: Encyclopedia of Electronic Components Volume 1: Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, Switches, Encoders, Relays, Transistors*, O'Reilly, 2012. [UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71290698970001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/encyclopedia-of-electronic/9781449333881/)

- Charles Platt, *Make: Encyclopedia of Electronic Components Volume 2: LEDs, LCDs, audio, thyristors, digital logic, and amplification*, O'Reilly, 2015. [UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71290765560001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/encyclopedia-of-electronic/9781449334178/)

- Charles Platt, *Make: Encyclopedia of Electronic Components Volume 3: Sensing Light, Sound, Heat, Motion, and More*, O'Reilly, 2016. [UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71290815340001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/encyclopedia-of-electronic/9781449334307)

### Microcontrollers

- Jeremy Blum, *Exploring Arduino: Tools and Techniques for Engineering Wizardry*, 2nd Edition, Wiley, 2020. This is my favorite Arduino book and assumes no previous electronics knowledge! [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP51311244450001451), [Wiley Online](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/doi/book/10.1002/9781119405320)]. Interestingly, Blum was inspired to work in physical computing after taking HCI Professor [François Guimbretière's](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~francois/) *Introduction to Rapid Prototyping and Physical Computing* course at Cornell.

- Dan O'Sullivan and Tom Igoe, *Physical Computing: Sensing and Controlling the Physical World with Computers*, Thomson, 2004. [UW Library Print Book](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71142983320001451)

## Where to Ask Questions

I *encourage* you to ask questions! There are so many people out there willing to help! Generally, however, it's a good idea to search a forum to see if your question has already been asked and answered before posting.

- **StackExchange**. The [Arduino](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/) and [Electronics](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/) StackExchange forums are extremely popular. 

- **Reddit**. While Reddit is not generally known as a thoughtful, respectful community, the subreddits for [r/arduino](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/) and [r/diyelectronics](https://www.reddit.com/r/diyelectronics/) communities are helpful and supportive.

- **Online Forums**. The most popular electronics and Arduino-based Q/A forums, include: [Adafruit](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=37&sid=39a6c8dce50981dcc363bdd5b0a77b23), [Sparkfun](https://forum.sparkfun.com/index.php), [Arduino.cc](https://forum.arduino.cc/), and [EEVBlog](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/).
