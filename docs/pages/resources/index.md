# Online Tutorials
- [Adafruit's 18-Step Learn Arduino Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/learn-arduino) is my most recommended "getting started" guide for Arduino. [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com), in general, has an extensive number of [online electronic tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/)—both for their own products and beyond.

- [Sparkfun's Tutorial Series](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials). Similar to Adafruit, [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) creates a large number of tutorials and videos to help the electronic/maker community (and build demand for their products).

- [NYU ITP's Physical Computing Course Website](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/). Tom Igoe's Physical Computing course at NYU's ITP offers a significant amount of online tutorials such as an introductory overview of [Electricity](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/electronics/electricity-the-basics/), [Sensors](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/sensors-the-basics/) and [digital I/O](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers/digital-input-output/). [Igoe](https://tigoe.com/) is one of the co-founders of Arduino and the author of [Physical Computing](https://www.amazon.com/Physical-Computing-Sensing-Controlling-Computers/dp/159200346X) and [Making Things Talk](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510510.do)

# Video Tutorials

- [Physical Computing @ ITP/NYU](https://vimeo.com/channels/pcomp). This online video series by NYU ITP's Jeff Feddersen & Tom Igoe provides over 100 extremely high-quality teaching videos about circuits, & Arduino

# Where to Ask Questions
- Stack exchange for EE Arduino
- Reddit with links to DIy electornics and arduino

# Books
While there are numerous Arduino and electronics books, generally, I find that online guides offer the best quality learning content. Some exceptions include:

## Electronics

- Charles Platt, *Make: Electronics*, 2nd Edition, Maker Media, 2015 [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71290798850001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/make-electronics-2nd/9781680450255/)]. The best 'Intro to Electronics' book I've found.

- Simon Monk, *Hacking Electronics: An Illustrated DIY Guide for Makers and Hobbyists*, McGraw-Hill, 2013. [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71297764200001451), [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hacking-electronics-an/9780071802369/)]

### More Advanced Electronics

- Paul Scherz and Simon Monk, Practical Electronics for Inventors, 3rd Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2013, Amazon (this is a more advanced book, e.g., the first chapter entitled Theory is 248 pages long).

- Charles Platt, Make: Encyclopedia of Electronic Components Volume 1: Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, Switches, Encoders, Relays, Transistors, O'Reilly, 2012, Amazon, Safari Online

## Microcontrollers

- Jeremy Blum, *Exploring Arduino: Tools and Techniques for Engineering Wizardry*, 2nd Edition, Wiley, 2020. This is my favorite Arduino book. [[UW Library EBook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP51311244450001451), [Wiley Online](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/doi/book/10.1002/9781119405320)]. Interestingly, Blum was inspired to work in physical computing after taking HCI Professor [François Guimbretière's](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~francois/) *Introduction to Rapid Prototyping and Physical Computing* course at Cornell.

- Dan O'Sullivan and Tom Igoe, Physical Computing: Sensing and Controlling the Physical World with Computers, Thomson, 2004, Amazon
